# Title
Energy Based Convex Set Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction Algorithm

# Abstract
Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) for given hyperspectral mixed pixel vector estimates the number of endmembers in the image along with their spectral signatures and abundance fractions. A novel algorithm called Energy-based Convex Set (ECS) is presented for unsupervised endmember extraction from hyperspectral data in this paper. The algorithm uses the concept of band-energy and convex geometry for extraction of endmembers. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it combines the spatial information from band energy and the spectral information from convexity for improvement. The performance of proposed algorithms and prevailing algorithms are evaluated with spectral angle error, spectral information divergence, and normalized cross-correlation for the synthetic and real dataset. It is observed from the simulation results that the proposed algorithm is giving worthy performance than other prevailing algorithms.
